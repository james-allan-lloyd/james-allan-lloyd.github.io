Here are my agile planning principles. These are not commandments, and its quite possible there's a lot of tension between each. Despite this, I hope they can be useful in your own agile planning endeavours.

- The product backlog is the plan.
- A single backlog is important so that everyone agrees.
- The product backlog is a communication device between the team and the stakeholders
- The product backlog is NOT a big list of TODOs for the team (ie, implementation details)
- The product backlog contains a list of problems to solve, in the order that they should be delivered
- The product backlog is NOT in the order of they should be started
- Agile specification is agile planning. They are in a cycle and the two cannot be separated, unlike in waterfall.
Content
- Features are not stories
- Do not do your software design in your stories
- Stories are descriptions of value, in the form of "if this problem was solved, we would have this value"
Size
- Small problems get solved, big problems are forever unsolvable.
- Don't reach for Epics just because your story is epic; being able to prioritize big and small things in a single backlog is important.
- Prioritization of big things is hard; if you cannot prioritize two stories relative to one another, make them smaller by splitting out the most value from each.
- Nothing is ever complete, so completeness is not a measure of value. Be wary of "all" and "every".
- That said, getting to done is the most important thing.
Detail
- Stories are incomplete specifications by design
- Over-specification is waste - only add detail to the most important things that will be worked on "soon". You don't know what will be important to specify in the future.
- Mistrust is waste - only add detail where it's necessary; trust the team to either ask or to make the right decision.
