    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>When I was in highschool I had a friend who was buddhist. When we were
organizing things he would tell me not to call during particular times because
his whole family would be meditating and wouldn't answer. I don't know if he was
particularly peaceful, but he definitely seemed pretty happy with everything.</p>
<p>He even asked me to go to a silent retreat once and to be honest, the thought of
how I would spend a week in silence really frightened me. I never went. And now
I carry this regret that I never did... whatever would have happened would have
been an experience.</p>
<p>Now I am fully on the meditation bandwagon. It is such a necessary practice, but
most people wonder why. Why is it so important to just sit with your thoughts?</p>
<p>It is because that you have two choices in this life. To experience your
thoughts - your hopes and dreams, fears and desires - or you have to choice to
experience the actual world, the base world, the base you. The unalterable
reality - although that reality cannot be ever truly perceived, if I have
learnt anything from my studies of eastern mysticism.</p>
<p>When you stop and realise how much of your experience of the world is actually a
construct of the brain, and that getting caught up in those constructs prevents
you from experiencing the world in peace (though this doesn't necessarily mean
without hardship). The amount of time, of precious mental energy that we expend
on things that will probably not happen (the future) and things we cannot change
(the past) - and not through your choice, but through habit.</p>
<p>Meditation is about changing that habit, and all the habits that derive from
that. Negative self talk, cravings, etc.</p>
