</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Here are my agile planning principles. These are not commandments, and its quite possible there's a lot of tension between each. Despite this, I hope they can be useful in your own agile planning endeavours.</p>
<ul>
<li>The product backlog is the plan.</li>
<li>A single backlog is important so that everyone agrees.</li>
<li>The product backlog is a communication device between the team and the stakeholders</li>
<li>The product backlog is NOT a big list of TODOs for the team (ie, implementation details)</li>
<li>The product backlog contains a list of problems to solve, in the order that they should be delivered</li>
<li>The product backlog is NOT in the order of they should be started</li>
<li>Agile specification is agile planning. They are in a cycle and the two cannot be separated, unlike in waterfall.
Content</li>
<li>Features are not stories</li>
<li>Do not do your software design in your stories</li>
<li>Stories are descriptions of value, in the form of "if this problem was solved, we would have this value"
Size</li>
<li>Small problems get solved, big problems are forever unsolvable.</li>
<li>Don't reach for Epics just because your story is epic; being able to prioritize big and small things in a single backlog is important.</li>
<li>Prioritization of big things is hard; if you cannot prioritize two stories relative to one another, make them smaller by splitting out the most value from each.</li>
<li>Nothing is ever complete, so completeness is not a measure of value. Be wary of "all" and "every".</li>
<li>That said, getting to done is the most important thing.
Detail</li>
<li>Stories are incomplete specifications by design</li>
<li>Over-specification is waste - only add detail to the most important things that will be worked on "soon". You don't know what will be important to specify in the future.</li>
<li>Mistrust is waste - only add detail where it's necessary; trust the team to either ask or to make the right decision.</li>
</ul>
